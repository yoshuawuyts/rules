> Instead of goals or resolutions, try creating rules

## Rules
- __I want to learn Rust this year:__ I will spend every
  weeknight between 22:00 and 22:30 using with Rust.
- __I want to learn Erlang this year:__ I will spend every weekend at least an
  hour using Erlang.
- __I want to become more fit:__ At least twice per weekend and once during the
  week I will engage in moderate to intensive exercise for at least 30 minutes.
  I will also consume enough protein before and after exercise to improve
  recuperation.
- __I want to eat more healthy:__ I will not eat prefab meals if I'm by myself.
  I'll plan the week ahead in the weekend, and do appropriate groceries to have
  breakfast, lunch and dinner provided. I'll prepare my lunch the night before
  so I can't forget.
- __I want to talk at conferences:__
- __I want to overcome jealousy:__
